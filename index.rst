===========================================
Part IA Flood Monitoring and Warning System
===========================================

*Lent Term 2021, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge*

Your team has been tasked with building the computational backend
(library) to a new real-time flood warning system for England. The
library should:

#. Fetch real-time river level data over the Internet from the
   `Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs data service
   <https://data.gov.uk/publisher/department-for-environment-food-and-rural-affairs>`__.

#. Support specified data query types on river level monitoring
   stations.

#. Analyse monitoring station data in order to assess flood risks,
   and issue flood warnings for areas of the country.

The mandated development practices are listed in the :ref:`Requirements`
section. The library is required to support specific query interfaces
(`API
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`__),
as outlined in the :ref:`Deliverables` section, which form the *public
interface* of the library.  Another company has been contracted to build
a user interface using the prescribed public interfaces to the library,
hence they cannot be changed.
