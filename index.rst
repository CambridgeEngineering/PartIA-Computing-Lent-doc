===========================================
Part IA Flood Monitoring and Warning System
===========================================

**DRAFT**

Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge

Your team has been tasked with building the computational backend
(library) to a new real-time flood warning system for England and
Wales. The library should:

#. Fetch real-time river level data over the Internet from the
   Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs data service.

#. Support specific data queries on river level monitoring stations.

#. Analyse monitoring station data in order to assess the flood risk,
   and issue flood warnings for areas of the country.

The required development practices are listed in the
:ref:`Requirements` section. The library is required to support
specific query interfaces (functions), as outlined in the
:ref:`Deliverables` section.  These are the *public interface* of the
library.  Another company has been contracted to build a user
interface using the public interfaces to the library.
